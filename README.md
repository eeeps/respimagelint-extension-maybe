# Remove board movement events from the GitHub Issue timeline

This extension can remove and restore the presence of timeline items generated by a project board event from GitHub's timeline.

I made this extension because I find the chatter these events generate to be distracting when working in larger organizations.

## How to use

Load this as an unpacked extension in your browser of choice. Currently this extension **only** supports browsers that support the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 format.

Click the extension's icon to remove board movement events. Click again to restore them. Neat!

## Known issues

The extension:

- Uses Manifest V3 (ew).
- Does not persist state across duplicate tabs/windows.
- Does not store last known state.
- Is not scoped to `github.com/*` sites.
- Will not work on GitHub sites where the Primer `d-none` CSS utility class is not present.

## Support

I will probably not publish this to browser extension registires. I also welcome enhancements and improvements for the known issues, but will likely not be working on them anytime soon.
